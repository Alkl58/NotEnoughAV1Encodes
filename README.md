## üî¨ How does this program work?
1. This program will split the given video file into chunks (scene based splitting or equal chunks).
2. After splitting, it will encode the chunks with n-amount of workers. 
3. When finished, it will merge the encoded files to a single video file.

## üêß Linux (Wine)
NEAV1E is written in .NET Core, which is in theory compatible with other platforms.

However as the WPF UI Framework is used, it is not compatible with the native .NET Core Version of Linux.

It is possible to run NEAV1E with the Wine compatibility layer (Wine is not an Emulator!).

The following YouTube Video demonstrates that: [Run WPF Applications on Linux (Manjaro)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1PWRYLuiNQ)
